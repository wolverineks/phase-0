## How to create a repo on GitHub and clone the repo to your local machine

1. after logging into GitHub, click on the 'plus sign' in the upper right hand corner, and select 'New Repository'
2. Give your repo a name, or GitHub will create one for you
3. Optionally, give your repo a description
4. Choose whether you want your repo to be public(default) or private(premium feature)
5. Optionally, select a gitignore file and license
6. Click 'create'
7. On the repos page, copy the URL next to the HTTP button or the SSH button.
8. in the terminal, enter 'git clone url_you_just_copied'

## What is Open Source

When software is described as 'Open Source', this means the human readable version of the code is readily viewable by the public.

## What do you think about Open Source?

Open Source is merely a tool. It can have benefits and costs. When other developers open source their code, it allows for more people to audit, contribute, and create. It is liberating and empowering to have such control over the software you use. However, this may  mean increasing the effort required to use the software, i.e. no GUI, poor UX, no binaries. Open Source software is not utopian. It is a tool that some developers use to increase contributions, speed up development, increase confidence in the software, create clones of already existing software but with increased control/features. Some people may have utopian ideas about software, but that says more about them than anything about the software itself.

## The importance of using licenses

Licenses are important insofar as you value what other developers and governments do in response to having them included with your code. There will always be some developers who act according to the demands you make in the license, and some who act contrary to the demands you make in the license. Using a license will likely increase the probability that developers will follow your demands.

The concepts solidified in this challenge were using git with the terminal and using the longer method to merge a pull request. The long method of merging pull requests was the hardest part.

I didn't research any additional resources.
