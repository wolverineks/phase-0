# 1.1 Think About Time


* In this assignment, I learned about giving myself less time to complete tasks.

* Time Boxing is setting a deliberate starting/ending time for tasks.

* I currently attempt to manage my time with Pomodoro Technique.

* My current strategy does not work because I don't stop working when the timer goes off, I don't start the timer, and my inconsistent schedule makes it difficult to carve out blocks of time for working.

* I can employ Pomodoro Technique, giving myself less time, and making my tasks smaller.

* For Phase 0, I will endeavor to make my schedule consistent, and arrange my personal daily tasks to allow Pomodoro Technique to fit better.



# 1.2 The Command Line


* A shell is a a text-based interface between the user and the inner workings of a computer.

* BASH, or the Bourne Again SHell, is a specific type of shell that is common to most distros of linux.

* The most challenging part of this assignment was staying disciplined with making flash cards.

* I was able to successfully use all the commands with many different options.

* I see the most important commands being: cd, pwd, mv, cp, touch, ls, help, man, info

* PWD: print working directory,
* ls: list files/directories in the current directory
* mv: move a file from its current path to a specified path
* cd: change directory
../:  change directory up 1 level
* touch: create a new file, or change the modified at time
* mkdir: create a new directory with specified name
* less: display pages of specified file
* mdir: remove directory (must be empty or returns error)
* rm: remove file or recursively remove directory (-r)
* help: display help file associated with specified command
