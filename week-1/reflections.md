# 1.1 Think About Time


* In this assignment, I learned about giving myself less time to complete tasks.

* Time Boxing is setting a deliberate starting/ending time for tasks.

* I currently attempt to manage my time with Pomodoro Technique.

* My current strategy does not work because I don't stop working when the timer goes off, I don't start the timer, and my inconsistent schedule makes it difficult to carve out blocks of time for working.

* I can employ Pomodoro Technique, giving myself less time, and making my tasks smaller.

* For Phase 0, I will endeavor to make my schedule consistent, and arrange my personal daily tasks to allow Pomodoro Technique to fit better.



# 1.2 The Command Line


* A shell is a a text-based interface between the user and the inner workings of a computer.

* BASH, or the Bourne Again SHell, is a specific type of shell that is common to most distros of linux.

* The most challenging part of this assignment was staying disciplined with making flash cards.

* I was able to successfully use all the commands with many different options.

* I see the most important commands being: cd, pwd, mv, cp, touch, ls, help, man, info

* PWD: print working directory,
* ls: list files/directories in the current directory
* mv: move a file from its current path to a specified path
* cd: change directory
../:  change directory up 1 level
* touch: create a new file, or change the modified at time
* mkdir: create a new directory with specified name
* less: display pages of specified file
* mdir: remove directory (must be empty or returns error)
* rm: remove file or recursively remove directory (-r)
* help: display help file associated with specified command



# 1.4 Forking and Cloning

## How to Create a New Repo:

### Github Method:

1. After logging in to Github.com, click on the 'plus sign' in the upper right corner of the screen.
2. In the dropdown menu, select the option 'New Repository'
3. Enter a name for your repo, or Github will create one for you
4. Optionally, enter in a short description of your repo
5. Select if you want the repo to be public(default), or private(premium feature)
6. Select if you want a Readme to be included automatically
7. Optionally, choose a gitignore file and license to be included automatically
8. Click 'Create'

### Terminal Method

1. in the terminal, create a directory for your repo
2. cd into that directory
3. enter the command 'git init'


## How to Fork a Repo

1. After logging into Github, navigate to the desired repo
2. click the button in the upper right hand corner labeled 'Fork'
3. select the desired destination account

## How to Clone a Repo

1. after logging into Github, navigate to the desired repo
2. locate near the top center what looks like a URL next to a button that says HTTP or SSH.
3. select the desired method of cloning by toggling the button that says HTTP or SSH
4. copy the URL that is displayed next to the button
5. in the terminal enter 'git clone ' followed by the URL you just copied.

## Clone or Fork?

* Clone if you wish to have a local copy

* Fork if you wish to have a copy of the repo in your github account, and potentially contribute to the project.


The most difficult part of Github was creating and associating an SSH key. This process helped me learn to use the terminal better.
